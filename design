For the final project, I started with finishing the input user interface which used to register the
username and maximum available steps. Searching from turtle docs.

Finishing the first part, I created 3 frame at first and store their position into another file
because I think it's inappropriate to put them as static final variable in the head of my main class

For the 3 frame, my first part is leaderboard, I check the image in canvas and a command line is
LOCATION: Game.read_leaderboard_file(), so I know that I can design a function to read file and
rewrite the file of leaderboard. Finally, I use a new pen to render the content of file into the
leaderboard.

My second part is designing the tile of the main frame, I designed a list to store the position of
each tile and everytime I changed the tile I will check the final status (whether it's same as the
original coordinate Or the cur_step has exceeded the maximum step inputted at first). For the rendering,
I choose to make sure the coordinate of left upper tile and test the interval for them to put, then
I use for loop to traverse the coordinate and put them into list to render.

The last part is designing 3 button and binding them with function. For the load, that's same as
initializing and I imported os to scan the file with .puz suffix and show them for user. For the
reset, I just need to render the picture by original position. For the quit, I just need to show
the finish picture for the user.
